When I first left the sea, I was overcome with heaviness.
<br /><br />Four arms searched for drier land, two kept close to my body if defense was needed, and one dangled behind lost in what was happening.
<br /><br />All squirmed under the weight.
<br /><br />A white glare with a trail splitting the sky burnt my eyes down the middle.
<br /><br />I puddled like blubber and fumbled over the lollipop swirls of an air-facing reef.
<br /><br />On first look back to sea, I saw my world new.
<br /><br />I'd never thought my life as blue before.

Moving further to a murmur inland, finds the source a jumble as I was, but unbending between joints.
<br /><br />Green, mostly.
<br /><br />Dark as black as parts got thinner.
<br /><br />Four uncoloured, thin fins stretched from it with fine, black lines searching for edges, and a limb of beads like a tentacle stuffed with pebbles stretching out from the inner bundling.
<br /><br />It wasn't until a fin slipped from its own grip that I noticed the hands - on arms as few as there were fins - relaxing from painting a fin red.
<br /><br />As it kept unfurling, a dual-bulbed head peeking outward.
<br /><br />The green, bulbous eyes took up most of the head and seemed rippled over themselves many times, like the reef pools hit by pinkish paint drips.
<br /><br />Two antennae, straight but tilting, signalled something I didn't understand.
<br /><br />All this was a strain to see in unfiltered light. I asked the thing in the best suface-speak I knew 'When would this blasted day dim?'
<br /><br />Over the slosh of the bubbling foam about the reef, I was not sure he'd hear me. My words felt sluggish and piled upon each other like the weed-ridden waves would overlap on the shore to make a louder crash.

I'd not seen anything but sand and cliff-face for a long-time.
<br /><br />Each step had a plume behind like a clap of a flour-covered hands.
<br /><br />Among much information I've forgotten, he told me his name was Anisoptera - but he prefers Aesop.
<br /><br />I shared mine as Haliphron.
<br /><br />He would call me Hali.
<br /><br />He did not walk evenly, his fall was little surprise when it came.
<br /><br />I was less struck by the ground and more by him finally shutting up.
<br /><br />Something frightened him, but it was a familiar sight to me.
<br /><br />An armoured warrior, much wider than he was tall (though still he looked down on Aesop and I when he was standing), with massive claws and a shield on his back.
<br /><br />But he was covered in a lichen, a tangle of deepest black over him when compared to the sugar-piles of sand dunes.
<br /><br />He was not moving much, Aesop likely mistook him for a rock until he had shifted to turn away from us.
<br /><br />Aesop must have overlooked the moment to think about controlling his limbs, his wings were abuzz.
<br /><br />I knew now how he looked when he was panicked.
<br /><br />The water that spilt from the bag dissolved the grains below me and seeped further down.
<br /><br />I was stuck in a small and quickly drying pit.

I had enough arms to grab all his shoulders and turn him to face me.

At the time I thought Aesop was changing his chromatophores, but I know now he doesn't have these.

Some distance along the cliff-face, before entering the cave, we looked away from a pulse in the sky shrinking to nothing, toward a pulse at the other end of the sky growing from nothing.

Once through the cave, the sky was dark. The tunnel was like many lengths of chocolate blocks molten then solidified together, so that no light would pierce and have told us how long we had talked in there. 
<br /><br />We talked of things so important it needs no written account to believe, nor clues to guess what they were.
<br /><br />At the tunnel mouth, where the running chocolatey walls are slowing under a cool breeze from a dark sky, it seemed wrong to talk of these things further.
<br /><br />Aesop had put the frontpack I occupied onto the ground and crouched in silence for a moment.
<br /><br />He raised his upper set of arms and held a finger out in front of each eye, his lower set held his hands in front of his abdomen.
<br /><br />The fingers at his stomach closed and opened while his arms held out to the sides of his face moved as if they were pulling a stretchy, invisible string through his head, side to side.
<br /><br />He then froze in place as his antenna twitched about his head.

I woke to a gentle shifting of my water-filled bag. Two of my arms felt the hands of Aesop at the straps so I was not startled.
<br /><br />It was when I heard him whisper to not make a sound that I became afraid.
<br /><br />Reaching out my arms I felt nothing but the forgiving reshapings of earthen trifle under the crumbling flakes of a dirt crust.
<br /><br />Opening my eyes I saw at the side of the cave mouth a white and pink thing of a great finspan - the fins seemed to have long bones within to keep them spread.
<br /><br />The body of the creature was a small thing in comparison and could be wrapped up within the fins. Still its stomach was likely large enough for both Aesop and I to be a full meal.
<br /><br />The head was snouted with small, sharp fangs covered in a yellow slime which a long tongue is continuously lapping up.
<br /><br />Less noticeably next to it was a cloak, black as a starless median sky but with similar white strands and pink flaps of a creature peeking out from within.
<br /><br />The one in the dark shroud seemed the only one speaking as the other was transfixed on drinking up the stream of thick and yellow sludge.

"Yes I recall your names. No-one in our known history has yet cohorently defined the shape of our world, so navigating it is a confusing task, aside from saying you are following the pulses or going against. If you're lucky, the stars haven't changed much in a generation. But what if you don't go along the pulse and instead to the side? I call this angle from the pulse direction the spin angle. Many say you can't really move that way as they don't see it affect their distance from the pulselight but we do seem to be able to move from each other that way. Maybe the pulselight wouldn't change as we expect. What if the pulselight sees what we thought of as lateral movement as a rotation instead, a walking around it like it is a sort of center to things. With this theory, you can get back to where you are even quicker by an entirely different path. If we live in a donut plane, we can fix our great supply chain issues by calculating the ideal spin angle for the fastest pathways the chain can span for pollenation and delivery. Everyone could even change where they live based on the spin angle that gets them a better line of delivery for what they need as everything constantly circulates, like a rotating helix about the pulselight. And for those of us with wings, we could fly directly into the sky and it would be the same as walking a greater length around the pulselight-".

We would see ourselves looking at ourselves. Not a reflection. Not a projection. Literal reality from two directions just like the pulse light does - but over a shorter distance this time. Comparing the length of the short spin-axis measurements with the long spin-axis which we get from the pulse itself, we can know the total volume of the whole sky. Entirely measurable.

I am a slave to this requirement.
You're asking me to let bits of me die instead of grow, I don't have a grasp on what such a thing means for me.
But if you can provide us a way to utilise this honey run-off - a way to store it and offload it - this may please all parts of me enough to implement it. I would like to keep good relations between your peoples and I.

"Maybe it is different in the water but here there is peace many sought for.
There wasn't for a long time, rhyme has said, though I've been cautioned rhyme's oft improportional.
But I don't need words to convince me, since I see it all around. Could I be seeing so much I've stopped thinking?
Have you noticed the lake that takes the side-length of mushroom county, it froths like the simmering of warm milk before bed.
It feeds to a delicate spiking of chocolate spires pittered with holes housing whole mountains of talkative termites.
See them rise in organised compromise, where their edge is a barely-taken bitemark on the edge of a cookie, left for others to share the taste.
And like crumbs in many number skittered from heat-soaked rock to shrubbery frock that dresses the foot of the sea-shell mountain, lizards and geckos littered on stucco have savoured no more than morning light allotted.
The fleeing pulse has angled its shadows, so shading green is the shallow and cool black is the deeps of the swamplands, where birds and bullfrogs are happy to sing all day for you.
I'm told their singing follows the beat of the drumming emus, a summing in melody and constancy to move an evening along.
That sound must scale the tower of spine keep, where the magus platypus preserves the gentle grazings of all echidna. Observing the farm always, except to see the pulselight wink at him from white to pink purple to to black each night.
Amazing as that is, a dotted line of arms wave about it, an army of ants make work instead of war. The great supply chain whose ends cannot be seen from any ground height."

It took several cycles of pulse-light for the ascent.
<br /><br />Again we spent much of it hungry.
<br /><br />So too, the waters of my bag were vanishing (more so than spills and drips would've permitted).
<br /><br />Aesop told me water will vanish back to the whole of itself, when part of it is separated for too long.
<br /><br /><i>How strange it is that things keep coming apart just to come back together</i>, I thought.
<br /><br />Half the ascent, Aesop laid me down in my bag and spent the waning light-stride flying back to Coptotermes to replenish our food stocks.
<br /><br />Before he left, I scoured the sharp cliffs for shells of strength, precision and beauty that Coptotermes might use to tend her fungal colonies - they are a special sort at that height. 
<br /><br />Oh, how fast he could have been without me, not having to endure the cumbersome and brittle, ancient seashells covering the mountainside. Like pins at his feet.
<br /><br />I'd not even thought of the pain of it until he had made the roundtrip. He hid that sort of thing well.
<br /><br />I felt too guilty to thank him, as I could never thank enough. <i>Better not acknowledge that I am insufficient</i>, I must have thought, <i>maybe he hasn't figured that out yet</i>.
<br /><br />I asked him of Coptotermes when he returned, but he said he didn't want to talk about it.
<br /><br />He said that he 'left the seashell shards where she would have found them'.
<!-- br /><br />Approaching the top, Aesop was at his most cheerful and we talked of the beautiful things he'd wish I could see:  -->
<br /><br />At the greatest heights, the titan shells jutted outward and shaded us as we heard the grind of appendages on the otherside of those dividing monoliths, footsteps or probings from spiralling bodies. I didn't dare look.

<br /><br />Aesop took a few steps back, but did not withdraw me from my decision.
<br /><br />I outstretched an arm to Agrotis, then I was limply hanging in the air and watching the mountainside pull away, Aesop rushing to dump the water from a bag I was no longer in, moving to fly after me.

<br /><br />Half-muttered wonderings of Aesop as his head swung around (as if he wasn't always seeing everything all the time): The spine is- where is- my- the base of it all- the end is- there it is- We can still- a lake for landing- at the keep- we'll be safe-
<br /><br />A burst of white powder and a heavy impact that I was shielded from, then water. Salty but surrounded by green?
<br /><br />My own half of the mutterings: What would I have after- No brood, no belongings- Nothing left- I might have liked to- were we not so different- with you- 
<br /><br />I didn't have the strength of a friend he would deserve, but I gave every arm I had to hold him at the bank of the salt-river. And I was ready to sit in the cold and spiked shadow of whatever was above, for as long as I needed to. For him. And I understood something of my mother then.

The population was dwindling with people moving down river to the coast, yes, but slowly. And there was still much respect for this place.
The things the magus knew to do... there is a reason the tower could be built, there is a reason the last war ended, there is a reason the flightless battalion accept order - without question - to go!
Oh, I'm sure everything will be fine. And of course they are still here, who would be ordering the battalion if the tower was empty?

Have I become a bad animal having my instinct to help all things overtake my instinct to protect the few I guardian?
To be a good father must I be a bad citizen?
Is being a good father to a few less worthy than being a good citizen to all?
Why preference your own over another when there isn't inherent value in anything really?
I guess I shouldn't muddle the question. If someone needs help, I help, and if my children are in fright, I flee with them. Either way my heart is in limiting harm and I wouldn't hate anyone else who worked to protect instead of hurt.

I took the arm damaged in the fall of the tower as it opened you to harm in keeping it.
I've helped a community of snakes remove the decaying grandmother turtle from its shell so they would have a place to sleep and remember the one for which they swore to atone.
I've helped a ladybird remove the ill-formed carapace that kept it's wings imprisoned.
Just recently I've helped a brave warrior cut off the claws that weighed heavy on his arms and mind.
I took my own wings because a wasp without wings is something others would fear less, and might even stand to trust.
Why my wings and not the stinger? I keep that to remind myself to stay honest about what I am.
We are born to be monsters. Our mother, Aesop's and mine, is all the evidence I need of that."

"I see it is hard to believe, let me explain.
My mother, which was not Aesop's mother, had implanted me into Aesop's mother during the Mighty Rush To Expand at the brink of the end of the last war.
My birth mother, which is also Aesop's mother, did not survive my onset, to my undying grief. And to Aesop's as well, of course.
His forgiveness is my only goal, though I know it is unattainable. Just as my own forgiveness for myself is too."

Sometimes I blame them for it too, why choose path destructive to themself? But then, think maybe it up to me to make it all worthwhile, and I didn't.
Then I got angry. I don't think home survive my first cycle out of the water.
I didn't turn - no look - but think monastery collapse flood home and now it is wasteland of sludge.
No forgiveness for me. Never."

"This all may be true - very probably from what I've heard, I am sad to say - but I will suggest you don't overstate your agency.
Something you may feel you have direct cause over was going to happen in some way no matter your action or inaction.
You are an animal among many.
You didn't doom your home.
Your home was simply doomed.
If it wasn't going to be you, it was to be someone or something else, for about the same outcome, given time.
If you had managed to act against it, the state of things would have only teetered some geological moments longer."

"No... no... Are you going to stay here or are you going to search for Aesop?
I think we both know your answer and we both know you won't find him anyway.
But still you will search, you will light some stars, and you must do so while knowing you won't find him.
I was lucky, to not be alone in my youth. Aesop would tell me no-one would care for me once I had grown up.
That nobody cared for anyone else and we all had to take care of ourselves.
Even still he cared for me as I grew.
And once I grew up, and we had separate paths, I kept meeting animals that wanted to help each other.
He had lied to me - maybe unintentionally, maybe not - but we all want to help, I know this to be true.
When we don't and when we make a plea of self-responsibility, it is the structure of the world we are living under forcing this.
But structures don't stay the same.
This statue of an old version of me will crumble and stagnate.
I hope the me that continues surviving will see something better, but it is foolish to think we get a say in what geometry forms a stable foundation.
If you're looking for a place to find your way to what stable ground is available, Aesop will look to the starlighters for help.
When the pulse-light goes dark, we'll need more of that kind.
But you rest now. It has been a journey and you still have much time yet to wander."

I am of the ocean.
<br />When a whale falls, it does not lay there it is picked apart.
<br />The vast deserts down there, unbroken by rock or seaweed, are reviled and avoided.
<br />The act of staining this leaf with ink to hold the facts of this story disagrees with me but I will do so.
<br />I will because if this story must be remembered, I want it remembered in its true form, unlike the twisted one that is being spread and recorded by others.
<br />If it is Aesop that has chanced this star and is reading this, I'm happy he has heard some of what I didn't have the words to say.
<br />I write many parts at once - sometimes without knowing - as my arms will understand what to say before I tell them.
<br />Any seeming contradiction is not, but something eagerly written from a viewpoint not concerned by another from my same body.
<br />Sometimes my arms have written without my knowing and I would find a finished leaf as I wake.
<br />I think an arm isn't all Anoplius took from me. She keeps hold of a truth I can't handle. A thought all remaining arms struggle to set to ink. What she wouldn't confirm. And that ambiguity keeps me lighting the stars for the surface dwellers and an Aesop that may yet still be.</div>
