When I first left the sea, I was overcome with heaviness.
<br /><br />Four arms searched for drier land, two kept close to my body if defense was needed and one dangled behind unsure of what was happening.
<br /><br />All squirmed under the pressure.
<br /><br />A white glare with a trail splitting the sky burnt my eyes down the middle.
<br /><br />I puddled like blubber and fumbled over the lollipop swirls of an air-facing reef.
<br /><br />On first look back to sea I saw life new, I'd never thought my world as blue before.

Moving further to a murmur inland, finds the source a jumble as I was, but unbending between joints.
<br /><br />Green, mostly.
<br /><br />Dark as black as parts got thinner.
<br /><br />Four uncoloured, thin fins stretched from it with fine, black lines searching for edges, and a limb of beads like a tentacle stuffed with pebbles stretching out from the inner bundling.
<br /><br />It wasn't until a fin slipped from its own grip that I noticed the hands - on arms as few as there were fins - relaxing from painting a fin red.
<br /><br />As it kept unfurling, the head peeked outward.
<br /><br />The green, bulbous eyes took up most of the head and seemed rippled over themselves many times, like the reef pools hit by paint drips.
<br /><br />Two antennae straight but tilting, signalling something I didn't understand.
<br /><br />All this a strain to see, I asked the thing when this blasted light will dim.
<br /><br />My words felt sluggish and piled upon each other like weed-ridden waves would overlap on the shore to make a louder crash.

I'd not seen anything but sand and cliff-face for a long-time.
<br /><br />Each step had a plume behind like a clap of a flour-covered hands.
<br /><br />Among much information I've forgotten, he told me his name was Anisoptera - but he prefers Aesop.
<br /><br />I shared mine as Haliphron.
<br /><br />He would call me Hali.
<br /><br />He did not walk evenly, the fall was little surprise, I was less struck by the ground and more by him finally shutting up.
<br /><br />Something frightened him, but it was a familiar sight to me.
<br /><br />An armoured warrior, much wider than he was tall, with massive claws and a shield on his back.
<br /><br />But he was covered in lichen, a stark tangle over him compared to the sugar-piles of sand dunes.
<br /><br />He was not moving much, Aesop likely mistook him for a rock until he had shifted to turn away from us.
<br /><br />Aesop must have overlooked the moment to think about controlling his limbs, his wings were abuzz.
<br /><br />I knew now how he looked when he was panicked.
<br /><br />The water that spilt from the bag dissolved the grains below me and then seeped further down.
<br /><br />I was stuck in a dry and small pit.

I had enough arms to grab all his shoulders and turn him to face me.

At the time I thought Aesop was changing his chromatophores, but I now know he doesn't have these.

I woke to a gentle shifting of my water-filled bag. Two of my arms felt the hands of Aesop at the straps so I was not startled.
<br /><br />It was when I heard him whisper to not make a sound that I became afraid.
<br /><br />Reaching out my arms I found nothing but rock and dirt.
<br /><br />Opening my eyes I saw at the side of the cave mouth a white and pink thing of a great finspan but they seemed to have long bones within to keep the fins spread.
<br /><br />The body of the creature was a small thing in comparison and could be wrapped up within the fins.
<br /><br />The head was snouted with small, sharp fangs covered in a yellow slime which a long tongue is continuously lapping up.
<br /><br />Less noticeably next to it was a cloak, black as a starless median sky but with similar white strands and pink flaps of a creature peeking out from within.
<br /><br />The one in the dark shroud seemed the only one speaking as the other was transfixed on drinking up the stream of thick and yellow sludge.

"Yes I recall your names. No-one in our known history has yet cohorently defined the shape of our world, so navigating it is a confusing task, aside from saying you are following the pulses or going against. But what if you don't go along the pulse and instead to the side? I call this angle from the pulse direction the spin angle. Many say you can't really move that way as they don't see it affect the pulselight but we do seem to be able to move from each other that way. Maybe the pulselight wouldn't change as we expect. What if the pulselight sees what we thought of as lateral movement as a rotation instead, a walking around it like it is a sort of center to things. With this theory, you can get back to where you are even quicker by an entirely different path. If we live in a donut plane, we can fix our great supply chain issues by calculating the ideal spin angle for the fastest pathways the chain can span for pollenation and delivery. Everyone could even change where they live based on the spin angle that gets them a better line of delivery for what they need as everything constantly circulates, like a rotating helix about the pulselight. And for those of us with wings, we could fly directly into the sky and it would be the same as walking a greater length around the pulselight-".

We would see ourselves looking at ourselves. Not a reflection. Not a projection. Literal reality from two directions just like the pulse light does - but over a shorter distance this time.

The fleeing pulse has angled its shadows, so shading green is the shallow and cool black is the deeps of the swamplands, where birds and bullfrogs are happy to sing all day for you.
I'm told their singing follows the beat of the drumming emus, a summing in melody and constancy to move an evening along.
That sound must scale the tower of spine keep, where the magus platypus preserves the gentle grazings of all echidna. Observing the farm always, except to see the pulselight wink at him from white to pink to black each night.
Amazing as that is, a dotted line of arms wave about it, an army of ants make work instead of war. The great supply chain whose ends cannot be seen from any ground height."

No-one else wears their feelings on their skin like I do.
<br /><br />I was tinted the grey-white of a newly scuffed reef but Aesop made no change in return.
<br /><br />I considered maybe he didn't notice, but of course he sees everything.
<br /><br />I was coming to the conclusion I had misjudged my trust for Aesop.
<br /><br />Would he break the promise he made in the middle of that long walk through the tunnel, after I confessed the reasons I had?
<br /><br />When he walked directly to the bullyfrog, I felt convinced of betrayal and prepared to rush to a nearby pond.

<br /><br />In the distance, I could hear the frog panic that the other shouldn't be here, but you could also hear uncertainty in his voice about ushering him on.

<br /><br />So too, the waters of my bag were vanishing (more so than spills and drips would've permitted).
<br /><br />Aesop told me water will vanish back to the whole of itself, when part of it is separated for too long.
<br /><br />Half the ascent, Aesop laid me down in my bag and spent the waning light-stride flying back to Coptotermes to replenish our food stocks.
<br /><br />Before he left, I scoured the sharp cliffs for shells of strength, precision and beauty that Coptotermes might use to tend her fungal colonies - they are a special sort at that height.

"Be grateful. An animal alone is a beautiful thing, scared and humbled.
When animals join together they are prideful and over-confident, causing trouble for themselves and everyone else.
Like the self-proclaimed humblebees.
When we group together we lose our truth, that individual instinct of survival in the body, aiming instead for survival in the mind.
You have pushed Aesop far, he is not as strong as I, he had to take many cycles to walk you here, alone he would have returned much faster.
I can fly you back before the next pulselight outsizes the current one."

"You must find strength to stand on your own, the easy path of swarm behaviour and following glorified fluid dynamics is not for you, nor for Aesop. I will stand you apart from the world of peace and war.
Animals disgust me, but each singular animal is a wondrous thing. I like each of you but I hate the two of you. What you two have started is beyond what you would have wanted for, when on your own. And we are all reaping the sowing.
The way to your home, was it this side of seashell mountain? How far have we gone around it?"

If I had not been, would they have sunk into themselves the same?
If Aesop is to have their same destiny, and if my father's act were the kinder one, you'd better take me pulseward."

As Agrotis orientated himself to the light, I could tell it was only I holding onto him now.
<br /><br />His arms languid and lapping at the passing air like weeds in the water. He took us higher.
<br /><br />I'd not experienced a speed like this - it felt as if I was in a tunnel, Aesop was getting rapidly faster, chasing into the entrance of it, but somehow getting no closer.
<br /><br />At some point, I was no longer seeing anything but Aesop an a pool of light, I could not keep my eyes open to see anything more.
<br /><br />Agrotis did not respond to my calls.
<br /><br />I am used to holding onto things tightly. Prey, grudges, pain. But this time I let go.

The fall was a long one with many things said.
<br /><br />Aesop was so afraid, and he didn't know where to look. But we found way to fall to each other.
<br /><br />I am not a heavy thing. I am missing more than most. Even still, when he caught me I felt him lose his lift. And I learnt something of my father then.
<br /><br />Half-muttered wonderings of Aesop as his head swung around (as if he wasn't always seeing everything all the time): The spine is- where is- my- the base of it all- the end is- there it is- We can still- a lake for landing- at the keep- we'll be safe-
<br /><br />A burst of white powder and a heavy impact that I was shielded from, then water. Salty but surrounded by green?
<br /><br />My own half of the mutterings: How different- a child- everything- me or you?- I might have liked to- were we not so different- with you- 
<br /><br />I didn't have the strength of one he deserved, but I gave every arm I had to hold him at the salt-river bank. And I was ready to sit in the cold and spiked shadow of whatever was above as long as I needed to for him. And I understood something of my mother then.
<br /><br />Something that craned above me had the strength to pull him from the waters completely.
